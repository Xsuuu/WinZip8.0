This is the What's New file for the WinZip 8.0.

(Note: A minor change that was made to the WinZip setup program
in December, 2000, is described at the bottom of this document.)


Major changes in Version 8.0

WinZip 8.0 includes significant enhancements for all WinZip
users, whether novice or advanced.  The new Zip and E-Mail
feature zips documents and folders and attaches the Zip file to
an e-mail message without leaving Explorer.  The greatly enhanced
Wizard can now create and update Zip files, as well as extract
and install from MIME and similar encoded files (great for e-mail
attachments). Improvements to the WinZip Classic interface make
it more Windows-like than ever; for example, an optional
Explorer-style toolbar is available, and, when creating or updating
an archive, WinZip automatically stores the same subfolders and
folder information that Windows Explorer would use for a similar
copy operation.  And installing those very popular desktop themes
and screen savers from Internet downloads has always been a
difficult and cumbersome process, but WinZip's new automatic
theme and screen saver installer makes it easy.

Details on these and many other enhancements follow.


Enhanced WinZip Wizard

- WinZip Wizard functionality has been extended to allow you to
  create and update Zip files from the Wizard.  After the initial
  Welcome panel, the Wizard displays a new Select Activity panel;
  from here, you specify whether you want to unzip/install,
  update an existing archive, or create a new archive.  Like the
  existing Unzip/Install Wizard, the new Add Wizard is designed
  to make the most common operations easy and convenient.

- The Wizard can now extract and install from MIME and other
  encoded files.  This makes processing of e-mail attachments
  from online service such as AOL and CompuServe easier for
  Wizard users.

- The Wizard now supports automatic installation of desktop
  themes and screen savers (see below for more information).


More Windows-like interface

- When you click the right mouse button on a file in the
  archive contents list, the context menu now displays any
  associated actions for the type of file selected.  For example,
  right-clicking on a .DOC file (Microsoft Word document) might
  display "Open", "Print", and "New".  As in Explorer, hold down
  the Shift key while clicking the right mouse button to add an
  "Open With ..." choice to the menu.  This menu item allows you
  to choose the application you wish to use to open the selected
  file.

- Inclusion of subfolders when adding, updating, etc., is now
  automatic and mirrors Explorer's treatment of subfolders.  You
  no longer have to check the "Include subfolders" checkbox;
  instead, WinZip determines when to include subfolders using the
  same logic that Explorer does.  Specifically:

   1) When individual files are added, WinZip does not look in
      subfolders for files with the same name.

   2) When a folder is added, WinZip always adds the contents of
      all its subfolders, just as Explorer always copies all
      subfolders when you copy a folder.

  The "Include subfolders" option in the Add dialog box is still
  available if wildcards (* or ?) are used in the filename field.
  This allows you to, for example, zip all *.DOC files in a
  folder tree with a single operation.

  WinZip automatically stores the same path information that is
  copied when using drag and drop or copy and paste in the
  Windows Explorer.

- Optional new "Explorer-style" toolbar buttons are available.
  These Internet Explorer-like buttons are simpler in style than
  the traditional WinZip toolbar buttons and optionally appear
  in gray, changing to full color when the mouse pointer is on
  them.

- WinZip now displays a tooltip when a Zip file is selected in
  Windows Explorer.  The tooltip shows how many files are in the
  archive and displays the archive comment, if there is one.  If
  "View as Web Page" is enabled in Explorer, the information will
  instead appear in the description area of the web page.  The
  Windows Desktop Update (Active Desktop) must be installed and
  WinZip shell extensions enabled in order to use this feature.

- When you click the right mouse button on a file in the archive
  contents list, the pop-up menu now displays only file-related
  actions such as Extract.  This is more consistent with general
  Windows conventions.  Use the Actions or File menu for
  archive-related actions like Virus Scan.

- Under Windows 98 and Windows 2000, WinZip menus now display small
  icons corresponding to the menu items' toolbar buttons.


Desktop theme and screen saver support

- WinZip can install desktop themes and screen savers contained
  in Zip files.  To use this feature, simply open a Zip file
  containing a theme or screen saver and click the Install
  button.  WinZip will extract all necessary files to the
  appropriate folder(s) and then run the required system theme or
  screen saver support application to complete installation.
  Theme/screen saver installation is also supported by the WinZip
  Wizard.  See online help ("Install Feature" topic) for complete
  information.


Other changes

- Zip and E-Mail adds a new feature to the Windows Explorer
  context menu. To use the feature, simply select files or
  folders in Explorer and choose Zip and E-Mail from the pop-up
  menu. WinZip creates a Zip file containing the selected items
  and attaches it to a new e-mail message. The Zip file is
  automatically deleted when your e-mail program no longer needs
  it.  This feature requires that a supported e-mail application
  such as Outlook be installed.

- WinZip can automatically display the Zip comment when opening
  a Zip file that contains a comment.

- When the open Zip contains a comment, WinZip displays a
  new icon on the Classic interface status line.  You can
  click the icon to view and edit the comment.

- Most of WinZip's major dialogs now have "What's This?" help.
  Click on the question mark in the dialog's title bar, then
  click on a control for quick information about how it's used.

- WinZip now displays an animated progress dialog during lengthy
  archive operations and can be minimized during such operations.

- The Miscellaneous tab of the Configuration dialog has several
  new options, allowing you to:

    - set the number of recently used files listed in the
      File menu,
    - enable or disable the theme/screen saver installer,
    - automatically show comments when opening Zip files,
    - enable or disable the animated status dialog used
      during long Zip operations, and
    - restore all warning messages that you have previously
      turned off.

- A new option in the System tab of the Configuration dialog
  allows you to control whether dialogs are shown when you drag
  and drop files from Explorer onto an archive or a WinZip
  window.

- The list of recently used files in the Classic mode File menu
  has been enhanced:

    - The case and capitalization of files in the list adhere to
      the preferences you have selected for files in the main
      WinZip window.

    - WinZip no longer places in the list files that were
      automatically opened from the Windows temporary folder.
      This means that, for example, temporary Zip files created
      by opening e-mail attachments won't clutter the file list.

- A new button for Close Archive is available and can be added to
  the toolbar from the toolbar configuration dialog.

- If you click the View button and multiple files are selected,
  WinZip will perform the specified action on all selected files;
  previously, WinZip only performed the action on the first
  selected file.  For example, if you click View when two .DOC
  files are selected, both documents will be opened.

- The WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition is now a 32-bit
  program exclusively and no longer supports creation of 16-bit
  extractors.

- Winzip's Windows extensions are now 32-bit Explorer Shell
  extensions only.  The File Manager extension is no longer
  supported.

- The System tab of the Configuration dialog has an option to
  change WinZip's associated file types.

- Miscellaneous improvements to online help.


WinZip Setup change (December, 2000)

The change to the setup program does not introduce any changes to
the WinZip program itself, WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition,
or WinZip online help.  Only the setup program (SETUP.EXE) is
affected.  SETUP.EXE has been updated to build 3105a; all other
distribution files are the original build (3105).

If WinZip 8.0 has already been successfully installed on your
system, there is no need to reinstall WinZip 8.0.

Details of the change:

During WinZip installation, if another program was running but
"not responding" to Windows, Windows did not properly complete
WinZip setup's requests to create Start menu entries.  This
prevented WinZip setup from running to completion.  The setup
program now detects whether or not this situation will occur; if
it will, installation is halted and the setup program informs you
that you must re-start Windows and then re-run the WinZip
installation.
