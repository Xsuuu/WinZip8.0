                         Suggested Description

WinZip is a powerful and easy to use utility for working with Zip files
and other compression formats.

WinZip features include:

32-Bit Windows support, including tight integration with the Windows
shell.  Drag and drop to or from the Explorer, or zip and unzip without
leaving the Explorer.

Internet file format support, including built-in support for Zip, GZIP,
TAR, UUencode, XXencode, BinHex, and MIME.

An interface to the Internet Browser Support Add-On, which lets you
download and open zip files from the Internet with one click.

WinZip Wizard:  This optional feature uses the standard and familiar
wizard interface to simplify the process of zipping, unzipping and
installing software distributed in Zip files.

Automatic installation of most software distributed in Zip files:
If a Zip file contains a "setup" or "install" program, WinZip’s
Install feature will unzip the files, run the installation
program, and clean up temporary files.

The "Favorite Zip Folders" feature lets you organize Zip files into one
convenient list that is sorted by date, making it easier to locate all
Zip files, regardless of where they came from or where they are stored.

Virus Scanner Support:  WinZip can be configured to work with most virus
scanners.

WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition:  Simplify file distribution by
creating files that unzip themselves.
