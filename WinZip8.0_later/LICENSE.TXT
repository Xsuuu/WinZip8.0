*** WINZIP STANDARD LICENSE ***

This license applies to the standard-licensed version of WinZip.
If you have an evaluation version of WinZip, see the section
below titled WinZip Evaluation License.

WINZIP LICENSE
WINZIP COMPUTING, INC.

You should carefully read the following terms and conditions
before using this software.  Unless you have a different license
agreement signed by WinZip Computing, Inc.  ("WCI") your use,
distribution, or installation of this copy of WinZip indicates
your acceptance of this License.

If you do not agree to any of the terms of this License, then do
not install, distribute or use this copy of WinZip.  If you paid
WCI or an authorized WCI distributor for this copy individually,
you may return it unused, within thirty (30) days after purchase,
for a full refund of your payment.

This copy of WinZip may either be used by a single person who
uses the software personally on one or more computers, or
installed on a single workstation used nonsimultaneously by
multiple people, but not both.  This is not a concurrent use
license.

You may access this copy through a network, provided that you
have obtained an individual WinZip license for each workstation
that will access WinZip through the network.  For instance, if 8
different workstations will access WinZip on the network, each
workstation must have its own WinZip license, regardless of
whether they use WinZip at different times or concurrently.

This copy includes WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition, which
may be used to create an unlimited number of freely
distributable, royalty-free self-extracting Zip files.  These
self-extracting Zip files contain, among other things, a portion
of WinZip Self-Extractor Personal Edition, including copyrighted
software, proprietary notices, and identifying information (the
"Extraction Software").  You may not alter or modify the
Extraction Software, nor give anyone permission to do so.

THIS SOFTWARE, AND ALL ACCOMPANYING FILES, DATA AND MATERIALS,
ARE DISTRIBUTED "AS IS" AND WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  In particular, there is no warranty
for the optional virus scanning feature.  (WinZip does not scan
for viruses, it simply runs external programs that claim to
perform this function.)  Good data processing procedure dictates
that any program be thoroughly tested with non-critical data
before relying on it. The user must assume the entire risk of
using the program.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT.

ANY LIABILITY OF WCI WILL BE LIMITED EXCLUSIVELY TO REFUND OF
PURCHASE PRICE.  IN ADDITION, IN NO EVENT SHALL WCI, OR ITS
PRINCIPALS, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES,
CONTRACTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, OR PARENT ORGANIZATIONS, BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER
RELATING TO THE USE OF WINZIP, OR YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WCI.

IN ADDITION, IN NO EVENT DOES WCI AUTHORIZE YOU TO USE WINZIP IN
APPLICATIONS OR SYSTEMS WHERE WINZIP'S FAILURE TO PERFORM CAN
REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL
INJURY, OR IN LOSS OF LIFE.  ANY SUCH USE BY YOU IS ENTIRELY AT
YOUR OWN RISK, AND YOU AGREE TO HOLD WCI HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS
OR LOSSES RELATING TO SUCH UNAUTHORIZED USE.

This Agreement is the complete statement of the Agreement between
the parties on the subject matter, and merges and supersedes all
other or prior understandings, purchase orders, agreements and
arrangements.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the State of Connecticut.  Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for
all matters relating to this Agreement shall be in courts and
fora located in the State of Connecticut, and you consent to such
jurisdiction and venue.

All rights of any kind in WinZip which are not expressly granted
in this License are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by
WCI. You may not rent, lease, modify, translate, reverse
engineer, decompile, disassemble or create derivative works based
on WinZip. You may not make access to WinZip available to others
in connection with a service bureau, application service
provider, or similar business, or use WinZip in a business to
provide file compression, decompression, or conversion services
to others.  There are no third party beneficiaries of any
promises, obligations or representations made by WCI herein.
